<b>Objective:</b><br> To create a functional calculator using React, HTML, and CSS that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and displays the result to the user in real-time. The calculator should have a user-friendly interface, be responsive on different screen sizes, and be built in a modular, scalable and maintainable manner.
<br><br>

<b>Functional Requirements:</b>
* Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Display the calculation result on the calculator's screen.
* Allow the user to clear the previous calculation and start a new one.
* Handle errors and display an appropriate error message if an invalid operation is performed.

<br>
<b>Outcome:</b><br>The final product is functional and user-friendly web-based calculator that is hosted on Firebase Hosting and can be easily accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
